      <h3>MONTAG</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h4>MONTAG.WTF</h4>
          <div>MONTAG Magazine was a futurist magazine sponsored by the marketing department of Grover from March
            2017 –
            April 2019. It had a pretty cool website that is now only <a href="
              https://web.archive.org/web/20200615162703/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.montag.wtf%2F">available through the
              Internet Archive Wayback
              Machine</a>. There were three print issues: <a href="/MONTAG1.pdf">TOGETHER TOMORROW</a>, <a
              href="/MONTAG2.pdf">BETTER BODIES</a>, and <a href="/MONTAG3.pdf">CODING CREATIVITY</a>.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>MONTAG.XYZ</h4>
          <div>When MONTAG the magazine ended in early 2019, I was beginning to be interested in LLMs and text
            generation (before it was cool) and
            created <a href="https://montag.xyz">MONTAG.XYZ</a> as its immortal AI-powered spawn and published it
            from
            May 2019 - June 2020. I
            wrote up the
            project including how I did the text scraping to create the data set and how I used Max Woolf's <a
              href="https://github.com/minimaxir/gpt-2-simple">gpt-2-simple</a> and Spell to train and
            sample from the model in Towards
            Data
            Science, <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/the-magazine-that-writes-itself-243ad03e6504">"The
              magazine
              that writes itself"</a> in June of 2019. Unfortunately Spell, the ML ops platform I wrote this guide
            for,
            is now defunct after being
            bought by Reddit in 2022.

      <h3 id="mathesis">Designing Embodied Conversational Interface
        Agents</h3>
      <div>Thesis written in 2018 for my master's degree in Communications Design from <a
          href="https://www.hmkw.de/">HMKW
          Berlin</a>. I wrote about human-computer interaction and natural language interfaces, and proposed a
        framework
        for designing interfaces which considers embodiment,
        anthropomorphism, realism, and situation as guiding principles. It also features case studies of well-known
        agents such as Clippy,
        Mavis Beacon, Ask Jeeves, and Realbotix Harmony AI. read it <a href="/MAThesis.pdf">here</a></div>

      <h3>Cyber Corpus</h3>
      <div>Thesis written in 2014 for my bachelor's degree in Art from <a href="https://www.reed.edu/">Reed
          College</a>.
        I wrote about embodiment and representation of the female body in cyberfeminist net art of the early 2000s,
        alternative
        (disembodied,
        fragmented, and reincarnated) embodiments, and
        embodiment alternatives in the bardo of cyberspace. read it <a href="/BAThesis.pdf">here</a></div>
