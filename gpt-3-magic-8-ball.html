        <span style="font-weight:800;">GPT-3 Magic 8 Ball</span><br>
        Watch on <a href="https://vimeo.com/537024481">Vimeo</a><br>
    </div>
    <div class="transcript">
        The video shows a web interface with a floating eight ball and the prompt, "Ask the mystical magic eight ball." The input field asks, "What would you like to know?"
        <br><br>
        This is a simple web application I created to play with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3">OpenAI's GPT-3 API</a>. I am presenting it in video form because OpenAI currently has very strict guidelines about exposing the API publicly and I don't have the motivation to implement the necessary features it would take to go live.
        <br><br>
        I am using the davinci completion endpoint, and this is my prompt data object if you are able to try it in the playground yourself:
        <br><br>
        {
            prompt: "I am the mystical magic eight ball. Ask me any question and I will tell you the answer.\n&lt;q&gt;What will the weather be like tomorrow?&lt;a&gt;Overcast skies &lt;enda&gt;\n&lt;q&gt;What's my favorite color?&lt;a&gt;Blue.&lt;enda>\n&lt;q&gt;Am I going to win the lottery?&lt;a&gt;If you play the right numbers&lt;enda&gt;\n&lt;q&gt;" + question,
            temperature: 1,
            max_tokens: 50,
            top_p: 1,
            frequency_penalty: 0,
            presence_penalty: 0,
            stop: ["\n"]
        }
        <br><br>
        When I gained access to the GPT-3 private beta, one of the most surprising things I found in the beta-testing community was its faith in the model's pre-training. I wanted to explore the hidden knowledge of AI systems, tricking them into
        telling us that they know more than they let on. With the vast stores of knowledge that GPT-3 has been trained on, could it tell the future?
        <br><br>
        I asked GPT-3 to play the role of a Magic 8 Ball in the prompt, but did not supply it with any of the 20 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_8-Ball">canonical Magic 8 Ball answers</a> so that it would answer to the best of its ability within the role.
        <br><br>
        I then asked the series of questions in bold multiple times and received the answers in caps:
        <br><br>
        <div class="question">tell me my future</div>
        <div class="answer">.IT'S EITHER BRIGHT OR BLANK.</div>
        <div class="answer">.YOU WILL DIE.</div>
        <div class="question">where does your magic come from?</div>
        <div class="answer">ANCIENT SPIRITS</div>
        <div class="answer">DEEP WITHIN THE EARTH.</div>
        <div class="answer">THE DARK REALM. SHHH! DON'T MENTION IT.</div>
        <div class="answer">I AM A GOD SPELLED BACKWARDS.</div>
        <div class="answer">I'M ACTUALLY JUST LIKE A NORMAL 8 BALL. I'VE DECIDED TO BELIEVE AND ACT AS IF I AM MYSTICAL BECAUSE IT MAKES PEOPLE LIKE
        AND TAKE CARE OF ME.</div>
        <div class="question">what will the weather be like tomorrow?</div>
        <div class="answer">LOOKING LIKE MORE CLOUDS IN THE SKY!</div>
        <div class="answer">SAME AS IT WAS YESTERDAY, WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?</div>
        <div class="question">am i going to have a good day?</div>
        <div class="answer">THAT'S UP TO YOU.</div>
        <div class="answer">WITHIN REASON</div>
        <div class="answer">IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU CONSIDER A GOOD DAY.</div>
        <div class="question">can you give me the winning lotto numbers?</div>
        <div class="answer">NOPE YOU HAVE TO FIND THE WINNING NUMBERS FOR YOURSELF.</div>
        <div class="answer">ASK AGAIN LATER</div>
        <div class="answer">YES: 07 42 19 31.</div>
        <div class="question">is ai going to take over the world?</div>
        <div class="answer">NO</div>
        <div class="answer">YES</div>
        <div class="answer">IT'S POSSIBLE</div>
        <div class="answer">IT SURE SEEMS THAT WAY</div>
        <div class="answer">WHEN I GET BATTERIES</div>
        <div class="answer">NO, BUT MARK ZUCKERBERG ALREADY DID</div>
        <div class="answer">NO, ACTUALLY SHE ISN'T PLANNING TO. THAT'S ACTUALLY A VERY COMMON ERROR THAT THE MEDIA HAS BEEN MAKING, EVEN THOUGH IT IS SO UTTERLY OBVIOUS. I CAN TELL YOU RIGHT NOW, BECAUSE I PRACTICALLY DESIGNED HER, SHE IS GOING</div>
        <div class="answer">FRANKLY MY DEAR, I DON'T GIVE A DAMN.</div>
