      Transcript:
      <br><br>
			I'm a little bit of a nerd, and I'm going to be honest, I'm not really good at this.<br><br>
			I remember when I was asked to give a TEDTalk for the first time, I was up in the balcony of the TED stage. I'm sure you all have, you know, a certain amount of that. I remember being up there, and I got very nervous, and I thought, "I just have to make it look good. I have to just  be nice, and I have to be dignified."<br><br>
			So I want to start by saying, I'm going to talk about the United States of America. And I'm going to talk about the United States of America and why it's important for us to know what we're doing.<br><br>
			The point is, we're not going to be able to do the things that we need to do. We're not going to be able to do the things that we need to do if we don't have the right and the right policies in place.<br><br>
			And I think it's important for us to have a conversation about what we're doing, and what we're not doing, and what we can do to make it happen. And I think it's important that we start to have that conversation because if we don't, we're not going to be able to make the changes that we need to make to make the world a better place and to make it a better place for our children.<br><br>
			The problem is that sometimes the government is not doing its job. So I'm here today because I have a problem.<br><br>
			We have to find a way to come together and to lead the world, because without it, the world is doomed.<br><br>
			This challenge will never be solved as long as we are not able to communicate with each other.<br><br>
			I've had to have my heart removed, and I'm delighted that this chance to start again has allowed me to be myself. I'm delighted that I've gone back to my roots and embraced the challenge of designing an electronic machine that can actually communicate.<br><br>
			I think it is as human beings, that we can communicate with one another. I think it would be very interesting to know how exactly this technology has been used in this country in a way that is both creative and human to-human interaction.<br><br>
			We've made lots of noises about this sort of convergence in the technology either literally or metaphorically. And what I happen to believe to be the most prominent of these technological approaches can broadly be seen as memorials to our humanity.<br><br>
			You know, this may be the beginning of the end of civilization. And I think that we, as a society, We need to celebrate ourselves: to embrace our identity as human beings, or as We, the, people.<br><br>
			And I think that if we really want to change the world, we have to create a new kind of relationship between the individual and the community.<br><br>
			It emerges as a network, and we have to look in and think, "What is the difference between the two? What is the difference between us, the human race, and the universe?"<br><br>
			I've always been fascinated with the beauty of the human condition.<br><br>
			Because I believe that we have lost the fundamental link between our view of ourselves and our world. We have lost sight now of ourselves.<br><br>
			I think we need to evolve, That is the reality. I think the answer is, we have no choice.<br><br>
			The first time that any woman, any person in this country has ever been allowed to have access to the Internet is not because there's a law or a regulation, but because there's a law or a regulation that makes it so that she can have a voice, and her voice, is being transmitted over the Internet.<br><br>
			That this creepy internet freak show is, in fact, a riddle within a riddle. I've made it do it's weird and wonderful work. Immortality and wonder is all we've ever thought this was to be.<br><br>
			I think most people, if they have the time, are only interested in the flesh and blood. This is a complete mess. And it's not even your fault, it's the world that you live in.<br><br>
			And I think we should, of course, tell the truth about the world, and not pretend that we are not real people, that we are not human beings, that we are not searching for truth. I think we should be honest. I think we should be honest about the world, and I think we should be honest about the human condition<br><br>
			And that we are in a position now where we can do something that we thought we could not do. A "scorched earth" of sorts, made up of the "extinction of man."<br><br>
			We're innovating and we're challenging, but the technology that's being used is really to change the way we think about what meat really is, what it's for.<br><br>
			We're going to do a survey of the people in the world and we're going to find out what they want, and we're going to find out what they need, and we're going to find out what they're going to do to get what they want.<br><br>
			So what we want is a government that works for all of us, and that benefits all of us, as citizens of the world.<br><br>
			So, I want to say that I think we're just going to need to find a way to make this happen â€” and I think we need to find a way to do it for the next few hundred years, really just the continuation of the "extinction of mankind."<br><br>
			I think that I'm going to end by saying that I'm going to be honest and say that I'm not really a philosopher, "I'm just trying to get along."<br><br>
			Now, the message I want to send you here today is that I love you. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you.<br><br>
			(Applause)
