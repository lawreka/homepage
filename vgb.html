      The Head
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      Virtual reality games may not be available in every American home yet, but the VR revolution is upon us. The barrier to entry is high: the equipment necessary to render these games at home is in the hundreds or thousands of dollars. The HTC Vive is retailing for $800, Oculus for $599, and that’s not including the PC necessary to run games at optimal speed and quality. However, there are VR technologies on the frugal end of the market that work with mobile phone technology, such as the Google Cardboard, at $21.95. Placing one’s phone horizontally in front of the face and within the Cardboard, the screen and paper facial apparatus block out any light or peripheral vision. This arrangement of visual immersion is the first gateway to feeling as though the head is situated in virtual space.
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      Another piece of the headgear setup that completes the illusion of cranial transportation are motion tracking cameras which must be placed near and facing the user, allowing the user to turn their head and see different parts of the virtual world. The Cardboard takes advantage of the accelerometric technologies already present in the smartphone to produce this same effect. Using the location of the head to track the user’s movement in physical space and virtual space simultaneously is one of the best tricks of virtual reality technology. As far as the eyes and ears are concerned, the head has been detached from the user’s body and transported somewhere else entirely.
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      This mechanic of head movement also creates problems, the most notable of which is VR Sickness, characterized by nausea and disorientation arising from the disagreement between the inner ear and the eye as to whether the body is moving through space. Another problem is room-scale VR, in which two dimensional illustrations must present a consistent illusion of three dimensional space. In addition to the visor strapped to the front of the face, the headgear of the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive include earpieces to transmit in-game sound designed for a 360 degree audio experience of virtual spaces.
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      There is a great philosophical quandary being demonstrated in virtual reality: whether or not sense data is a reliable metric for determining reality. Those who doubt that perception creates reality can be assured by the notion that virtual reality is unreal, and yet our powers of perception are fooled, proving sense data is not infallible. The opposing view, however, argues that the ability of our senses to be fooled entirely by virtual reality only proves the unreality of our current reality.
    </div>
    <div class="lead right">
      It’s a head trip… but the head isn’t always along for the ride.
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      In some VR games the head and the camera share the same perspective; whatever the player is looking at is what the camera sees. This effect is particularly apparent in games where the user’s view is simulated as though they’re wearing a helmet or goggles in the virtual world. An in-game heads-up display or overlaid screen on top of virtual headgear is most common for the combat, flight simulator, or spaceship genres.
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      In <span class="i">Adrift</span> for Oculus, the protagonist floats through a space station, picking up the pieces after something has gone wrong. The user sees through their eyes and has the ability to turn their head within their space helmet, but after a certain amount of left or right movement, can only see the inside of the helmet. It has been made impossible to turn the neck 180 degrees, a realistic touch that is lacking from many first person perspective games.
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      It would be a safe design principle for virtual reality experiences to never allow the user to see their own head, but it wouldn’t be nearly as interesting either. Several games that were released when the Oculus was first made publicly available have made the more difficult design choice to allow a third-person perspective camera to turn on the user.
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      Many of the Oculus games that are designed for space exploration or racing (or spaceship-racing) have the user inhabiting a virtual body that remains seated at a control station for the duration of the game. Because it’s the vehicle and not the body itself that moves through the larger virtual space, these bodies are not designed to be seen from a third person perspective. Several games including <span class="i">Eve, Radial-G Racing, Project Cars, VR Karts, Firma,</span> and <span class="i">Time Machine VR</span> allow the user to shift the camera’s perspective enough to see that the bodies they are inhabiting in these games are headless.
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      In <span class="i">Eve</span>, the protagonist’s body is encased in a sleek black spacesuit, looking down shows the figure’s legs covered in the same material, but stepping away or above the correct seated position reveals that the neck is a featureless black stump. Standing up allows the user’s head to pass through the cockpit that supposedly separates them from the vacuum of space. The same clip-through effect can be accomplished in <span class="i">Project Cars</span>, where the figure the user inhabits is also visible encased in a full-body racing suit, but if the camera is moved to the perspective of the passenger seat or the front of the car, the head passes through what should be the solid walls of the cabin, and the neckline of the suit is revealed to be empty. There is no neck, and no head on the driver.
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      There are many 360 degree video experiences available on the Oculus and Steam stores, including short films, simulations of flying, roller coasters, underwater exploration, and other games that provide a purely narrative experience. The user will never notice that their representation inside of these virtual worlds is entirely incorporeal, because they aren’t assuming any identity except as a passive observer. When the head and hands are necessary for the user’s assumed identity to interact with the environment, however, things get more interesting.

      The Hands
    </div>
    <div class="lead right">
      Reality check: how do you know if what’s in front of you is real?
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      A common technique used by lucid dreamers and psychonauts alike is to study one’s own hands. To know “like the back of your hand,” is to be familiar enough to have a solid grip on reality. If one’s own hand presents itself as something unique and unseen-before, the test is a testament to a severely altered state of perception. In virtual reality, where the unreal is the expected, even this simple test is very hard to pass.
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      Both the Oculus and HTC Vive headsets are compatible with handheld devices that track physical movement in virtual space, but the consumer version of the HTC Vive ships with them included and the Oculus does not, and is compatible with more traditional (non-motion-tracking) game controllers. The handheld devices for both types of headset share a design in which the controller wraps around the hand. This design is to prevent fatigue from constantly gripping the controllers and provide for an experience in which the user forgets the object entirely, and thinks only about using their hands naturally to manipulate virtual objects. Another more specialized design for this kind of gear is a sensor-laden glove, but the one-size controller that wraps around the hands is obviously much easier to manufacture than snug and clothing-like wearable controllers.
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      The position of the hands in physical space and the triggers and buttons on the controllers can be used to manipulate objects in virtual space, but when or whether the hands actually appear in the virtual world, and if they are attached to a body, varies greatly according to the genre of game in question. Many of the Vive games that resemble real-life sports, like <span class="i">Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe</span> or <span class="i">Pinball FX 2</span> eliminate the hands entirely. It proves to be very intuitive in a game of virtual air hockey to move the mallet without seeing the hand that moves it, although it looks like it’s moving on its own. The technique of eliminating the hands entirely is also used by games like <span class="i">Dreadhalls</span>, an Oculus horror game, where the user feels as though they are picking up and manipulating objects as they move through the dungeon, but the objects actually float in front of them.
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      The tutorial for <span class="i">The Gallery</span> on Vive finds the user disembodied except for hands in a black and cyan almost featureless landscape with dark square stones on the ground. A soft female voice (revealed shortly after the tutorial to be the voice of the protagonist’s sister) says she’s “Glad you made it… But first, I have to teach you a few things.” She directs the user to look at their hands, which stop a few inches above the wrist and are blue-tinted from the atmosphere of the game, but appear white, with fingerless gloves on. She guides the user to use the buttons on the Vive controllers to clench and unclench their fists. Grabbing bottles that appear on pedestals from thin air and shattering them on the ground is the next task. While the hands are present, and their ability to interact with these objects is realistic, their disconnection from anything (like arms) ruins the effect of embodiment entirely, and attempting to smash a bottle on the space where the user’s head should be has also been proven to be impossible.
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      Another narrative-driven game, the Vive’s <span class="i">A Chair In A Room</span>, has the same hand display: white male human hands cut off a few inches above the wrist, floating wherever the controllers are in space. No other body parts are visible, although outlines in the floor can be seen for placing the feet, and some objects can interact with the space where the head would be. The user is guiding the protagonist character through a series of what appear to be tests of mental competence, in a series of small rooms, each with a metal chair and a window through which an observer in a lab coat provides instructions. Because this game’s protagonist appears to have a fragmented identity and altered perception as part of the plot (they are given pills to dispel “visions,” which provide the horror element of the game) it may make sense in this case for the character’s body to be fragmented. When holding or manipulating objects, the hands become semi-transparent blue instead of solid beige. This translucency appears to be designed for the sake of manipulating small objects and not having to animate their collisions with the hands precisely, not for a narrative effect, but nonetheless appears spectral. It occurs to the user that the body may not be reliably present, or the self as real as the objects in its environment, the titular chair and room.
    <div class="smalltitle left">
        The Ghost Body
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      When the motion tracking cameras are placed in an appropriate spatial configuration and the HTC Vive headset has been placed on the head, the real objects in the environment of the user become the game environment in the home screen. The camera displays the user’s actual room and body through a powerful cyan filter. Everything is virtualized, with outlines illuminated and smoothed. The texture of the arms and hands looks different, and walls that designate the playable space, determined by where the sensors are placed, become a grid. From this interface, the camera can be turned off so that the home page is just a grid world, a black and white void with intersecting lines running across the ground and sky, where the human body disappears, leaving floating controllers.
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      In the Oculus store interface, the entry point when the headset is strapped on, the user is situated in what has been described as a cozy living room with a crackling fireplace, but again there is no physical self to be found. The feeling of inhabiting this very livable, comfortable space, with no corporeal form representing the user’s body, has been described by many as “ghostly.”
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      This choice, while somewhat spooky in practice, has a sound ideological basis when considering the alternatives. Consider the challenges of establishing a default identity to embody the user in their first step through the portal of the virtual. In the past, game developers have considered it safe to assume that the user is a white cisgendered male. The progressive choice could have been to follow Nintendo or Xbox’s model of allowing the user to build a cartoon avatar that resembles themselves, but these graphics are necessarily limited and the reality of virtual reality would be forfeit from the start. One imagines they could choose from a set of customizable realistic body parts and clothing, but there are very few mainstream platforms that allow for the expression of identities that differ from binary gender norms, or allow for a variety of skin tones, body types, or abilities; Linden Lab’s <span class="i">Second Life</span> may come closest. While it can be argued that erasing identity is far from an adequate substitution for accurate representation of the full spectrum of humanity, it seems that being entirely disembodied by default is not only the easiest and least likely to break the immersive illusion of virtual reality, but also the most egalitarian choice.
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      In many games with stylized cartoon worlds and characters, the head and hands are represented only by accessories that hang off of invisible or incorporeal bodies. The Vive’s <span class="i">Job Simulator</span> and <span class="i">Bowslinger</span> both place the user in a fully illustrated world. The former is a museum of the future, humorously documenting life at a corporate office in the 21st century, and the latter is an archery simulation. In <span class="i">Job Simulator</span>, white gloved hands a la Mickey Mouse hover in front of the first-person perspective, and from the third person camera, a headset that looks like a cartoon version of the Vive appears to be strapped to an invisible head. In <span class="i">Bowslinger</span>, the gloves are brown, and the head is represented by a version of the headset in the cartoonish art style of the environment (the front of the visor is stamped with “VR”), but for further hilarity, the head space is also topped by a Robin Hood-style green hat with a red feather coming off of its left side and an arrow through the middle, with the point facing out the front of the head and the fletch coming out of the back. In <span class="i">Omega Agent</span> for Oculus, where the protagonist is a spy wearing a jetpack, the hands project from suited arms, a white cuff is visible under a dark colored jacket sleeve, but the arm fades into nothingness at the elbow and the rest of the character is incorporeal. The character of the game, and the character the user is embodying, are both enhanced by these small aesthetic touches to the disembodied self.

      The Rest
    </div>
    <div class="lead right">
      Who are we when we are in VR?
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      The popular <span class="i">Windlands</span> game for Oculus doesn’t provide any visual reference to the hands, head, or body of the character, but makes the user feel as though their whole body is swinging through the air, even though they are incorporeal in the world of the game. The technology necessary to produce a full-body immersive experience, sensing the entirety of the user’s body and projecting their movements onto a virtual avatar isn’t far away. Certain advanced motion sensing cameras can already perform this translation with fair reliability. It should be possible soon for users to encase their bodies in receptive gear that would be able to transmit more complex haptic data, such as sensory feedback from actions taken against their bodies in the virtual world. The Teslasuit, a crowd-funded technology that gained prominence in January of this year is the closest real-life example of a controller with this kind of full-body immersive capability, which thus far has been limited to science fiction books like Ernest Cline’s <span class="i">Ready Player One.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      However, if a game like <span class="i">Windlands</span> can produce the sensation of full body motion with no body represented at all, additional sense data could also be more of an opportunity to cause conflict or confusion, not to mention the cost. The ghost body, or incorporeal embodiment, causes only one type of cognitive dissonance, the lack of a self, which users have been shown to adapt to quite naturally.
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      Is it frightening to become a ghost in virtual reality? It doesn’t seem as scary to be a ghost as it does to be a fragmented body, or to be forced to assume an uncomfortable identity. No hands seem preferable to hands that don’t perform as hands are understood to in physical reality. Having no hands doesn’t seem to stop a ghost body from wearing gloves, or ghost heads from wearing hats and goggles. It isn’t even inconvenient to be a ghost, if the ghost body can still interact with the virtual world. Perhaps that what’s most exciting about inhabiting a virtual ghost body, not having to be corporeally present to see all that can be seen, to walk through walls at will, to break the limitations of physical space and explore vast and ever more beautiful virtual realms.

      Thinking outside the body, everyone can be one: ghosts are post-space, post-gender, post-embodiment, post-identity; and we’ll all be ghosts eventually.
